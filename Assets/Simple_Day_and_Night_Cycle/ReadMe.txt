Thank you for downloading this free asset!

This is just a simple Day and night cycle.
The purpose of this asset is to add a bit of realism to your survival game, or RPG game, or any game really where you want the days to go by,
literally.

All code has been documented with comments so you can tell what everything means, and where everything is.

Contents in this package:

(all scripts written in c#)

-a day/night controller script
-a playable scene to demonstrate the abillities of this asset
-a visual moving clock object and script
-A character controller.
(PLEASE NOTE: the character controller is not made by me, but by Unity Technologies. Therefore, all credit goes to them. It is in this pack as just and example for the playable scene. Again please note, it was not made by me.)

Setting it all up: (Tutorial)

-you may use the prefabs provided; therefore making no use for this tutorial. It is here for the sake of people who "want to do it themselves".

1. start with a basic scene. File->New Scene

2. add a terrain for your character controller to walk on. (Optional) GameObject -> 3D Object -> Terrain

3. Delete the Main Camera from the scene. (Optional)

4. Drag and Drop the Character Controller Prefab from it's folder (Optional).

5. Go to the prefabs folder, and drag and drop the "Day and Night Controller" into the scene.

6. In the empty "Directional Light" slot, assign the scene's Directional Light object to it.

7. From here, you can tweak the Seconds in a Full Day var to something you like. to keep it symetric, put the value to seconds in a full minute. (EX: 60 = 1 full minute.)

8. Hit play, and there you have it! if you wait a bit, you can see that the sky will be getting a little brighter. (default is night time).

Again, thanks for downloading this, and have fun.
