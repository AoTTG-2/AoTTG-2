//Original map idea;
//The whole thing would be a follow-the-pillar map, from the bottom.  You have to go up continually, going to the sides then going up through another obstacle to get to the next higher segment, where you return to the pillar (and a checkpoint).  Overall, it would be very very wide open.  Once at the top, you have to jump off the map entirely, then go under it, and back up, sweeping upwards (and grabbing segments of the map geometry) to get to the very top, where the pillar has become a checkpoint.  Also, start on the bottom, then go over the side.;
