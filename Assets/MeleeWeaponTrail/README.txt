Melee Weapon Trail 1.0


Usage:

Attach the MeleeWeaponTrail script to the bone of your 3d model where the weapon is mounted. Add a child game object to that which designates the tip of the weapon, and assign the values in the inspector. I've included a helper script to tell when the MeleeWeaponTrail should emit or not based on the animation's frames.

Tip: Make sure to set your trail texture's wrap mode to clamp in the import settings.
