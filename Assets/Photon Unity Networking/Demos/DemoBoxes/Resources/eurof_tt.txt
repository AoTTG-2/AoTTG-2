The eurofurence typeface family by tobias b koehler (unci@tigerden.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a family of geometric rounded sans serif fonts consisting of
three weights (light, medium, bold) in upright and italic styles,
originally designed for EuroFurence, the first European furry convention
1995 in Kaiser-Wilhelm-Koog.

The character set includes Roman, Greek and Cyrillic characters.
File format is TrueType for PC (under Windows, Linux etc).

These fonts are freeware and can be distributed as long as they are
together with this text file. I would appreciate it though if you could
contact me at unci@tigerden.com if you put them on a server. Free
samples from commercial users are always very welcome. :)

Have fun!                                   tobias b koehler, 2000-04-02
