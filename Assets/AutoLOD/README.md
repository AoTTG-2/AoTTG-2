# AutoLOD

AutoLOD is a very simple tool that will generate a LOD group with any 3D
object from your scene. It will automatically compute simplified version of your
meshes using decimation.

## Setup
The whole package is contained in the AutoLOD folder resulting from the import.
You can move it wherever you want, but it is recommended to keep the same
folder structure.
## How to use
AutoLOD consists in an editor window. You can open it via Window->AutoLOD->MeshDecimator.

Put the object(s) to be processed into the ”targets” area. Please note that
a Renderer is required otherwise the object cannot be added.
By default, the same presets will be applied to every renderer in the list.
You can customize these presets in the Custom Settings section.
You can also customize per-object settings by folding out targets in the list.

Both settings panels are identical, meaning that each object is fully customizable independantly from others or from the common settings.

The LODGroup Settings foldout let you control the LODGroup setup as
it should be when created, but you can still change it manually when the
process is over. You cannot interact with the LODGroup widget (which is
NOT the actual widget, but just a representation), only the sliders LOD Levels,
Seamless/Performant and Size Culling will influence it.

You may want to save the decimated meshes to the assets. You just have to
check the Save meshes to Assets toggle and enter a path. If the path does
not exist, the program will automatically create it for you.
When you are ready, just click on the button Generate LOD.

## Features
• Minimalist interface and really easy to use
• Works in both edit and play mode
• Works on prefabs instances (no need to unpack them)
• Generated objects can manually be saved as prefabs as long as the toggle
Save meshes to Assets is checked with a valid path.
• Generates up to 8 LOD for a single object
• Decimates UVs (from uv1 to uv4) and bone weights too.
• Compatible with sub-meshes
• Creates colliders for simplified meshes (if the source has one)
• Can be used for simple distance culling too
• Fully compatible with any render pipeline
## Some tips
• A demo scene is provided in the Scene folder: click play and follow the
instructions. The provided material in the scene should appear pink in
LWRP/URP and HDRP. Feel free to upgrade the material to your render
pipeline, or use your own material.
• The toggle Optimize Source Mesh applies a Automatic Decimation to
the source mesh. It’s not recommended for detailed meshes, but it can
help for basic shapes, such as a cube subdivided in more vertices than it
should be.
• Setting 1 on LOD Levels will just apply a distance culling (and an automatic decimation if the toggle is enabled).
• You can apply changes to a prefab instance, as long as the decimated mesh
were saved to the Assets (otherwise the meshes will be missing, as they
are stored in the scene data).
• You can undo the whole AutoLOD process with Edit -> Undo
• You can put several objects in the drag and drop area. AutoLOD will just
add the valid ones to the list.

## Warning
• Generation can take several minutes for a whole scene. Unity will freeze
during the process but a progress bar will provide a visual estimation of
what is happening. The progress bar is more precise for Unity 2020 and
above than the previous releases.
• If the processed object has specific components attached to it, they will
remain but make sure they still work properly. If they were using the
attached MeshFilter or Renderer, they will probably be broken, but it
should be easy to fix in most cases.
• Please check carefully which objects you put in AutoLOD and understand
that there are just too many cases that can end up with bugs, especially
with your MonoBehaviour scripts.
