AYo 
hum 
thanks for the money 
i think my shader is cool 
now
how to setup:

if you're lazy, just go into the prefab folder, and plop the prefab into the scene, then add a reflection probe or your prefered reflection method, and you're good to go.

if you're cool or have custom meshes, its pretty simple, make a material, set it to use the shader, plop the necessary textures in, and add the Venitian Water System script, and bam you can start controlling.

you only need one instance of the script per scene or water type, so if you have multiple objects using the same material, you only need one instance of the script, if you have 2 objects with different water materials, you'll need one instance for each material
the scripts need to be on a object that has the concerned material

you can do whatever with the water shader, you dont have to credit me but id love it if you do so that i can brag, always cool to see your work in a bigger project

if you got any problem just send me a email and ill respond eventually... maybe...
