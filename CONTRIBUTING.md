# Contributing to AoTTG2

Thanks for your interest for contributing to AoTTG2! This open-source project completely relies on volunteers, and we need you to make it happen!

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [AoTTG2 Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to any of our discord moderators.

## How can I get started?

Within AoTTG2, we have several teams which each has their own responsibility. We have the following teams:
* Development Team. The software developers writing and maintaining the code for the AoTTG2 Unity Client, AoTTG2 Photon Server and AoTTG2 API.
* Art Team. The artistic people that create assets such as 3D models, textures, animations and music for AoTTG2.
* Mapping Team. The map creators of AoTTG2.
* Testing Team. The testers of AoTTG2 that are responsible for quality assurance and reporting bugs to the development team.
* Translation Team. (Not yet available) A group of contributors that are creating accurate translations for the game.
* Moderator Team. The moderators who enforce the code on conduct, community guidelines and rules to assure that a healthy community exists.

For all of our social interaction we are using Discord. You can join our discord server here: https://discord.gg/GhbNbvU

To apply for any of the teams, please make use of the appropriate discord channels.

## I have joined a team, what now?

Your activities that you will be participating in depend per team. For every team member, you should have read and followed the instructions from our [Github Wiki pages under the Basics category](https://github.com/AoTTG-2/AoTTG-2/wiki).

## I have an idea, should I create a new issue for it?

Whereas we do encourage you to rather make use of discord, you may also do issue proposals via Github Issues. When making use of this feature however, please mark them with the "Proposal" label. An investigation will then follow to determine if we can implement your idea, and in which milestone it will be moved.
