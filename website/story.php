    <p class="story-para">At AoTTG 2 we strive to continue an indie game known as Attack on Titan Tribute Game, developed by <a href="http://fenglee.com/game/aog/">FengLee</a>. Whereas AoTTG has been enjoyed by thousands of players during the years, it does have it's flaws. AoTTG hasn't received any updates since 2016, and there won't be any either. There have been mods which did great to keep the community alive, such as the RC or EM mod, but they are limited. 
    With AoTTG 2 we will take things a step further. We will upgrade the Unity engine of AoTTG, as it's very outdated, resolve the core issues and develop new features for the game.
    So you may be asking yourself, why one of these projects again? Project X tried to do the same, and that died as usual.
    AoTTG 2 is completely open-source, licenses under GNU General Public License v3.0. This means that everyone can implement new features, resolve bugs and make the game better as it is. Even if the original development team of AoTTG 2 stops with the development for whatever reason, someone else can always freely join the project and contribute. The community develops the game, and together we can make it something great.</p>
