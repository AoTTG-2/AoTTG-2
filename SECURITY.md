# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Before reporting a security vulnerability, please check the AoTTG2 version you are using:

*Currently the only version supported is the latest development version. Upon release, we will only support the latest versions, and strongly encourage our users to upgrade*

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please do so [here](https://github.com/AoTTG-2/AoTTG-2/security/advisories/new). 
Please do not disclose any of this information to the public. Whereas we can resolve every security vulnerability to AoTTG2, the same may not be said for AoTTG. The least thing we want is that AoTTG gets ruined in its final few months before AoTTG2 is released.
