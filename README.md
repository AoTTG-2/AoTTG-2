# AoTTG-2
## The future of AoTTG

Welcome to the official AoTTG 2 repository! From here, we are developing an open-source project known as AoTTG 2. AoTTG 2 is a community effort to continue the development of an indie game known as ["Attack on Titan Tribute Game"](http://www.fenglee.com/game/aog/) (AoTTG) developed by FengLee. AoTTG was released in 2013, yet development ceased ever since 2016. Whereas FengLee is not working himself on AoTTG 2, he has given us permission to work on AoTTG 2 ([Source](https://weibo.com/1664859317/J9bZrB0kh))

The community kept the game alive by creating various mods, but now it is time to move to the next level. The community of AoTTG is large, and by combining our powers, we have forged the AoTTG 2 community.

## How to contribute

As this project is open-source, the development is completely community driven. To make AoTTG 2 become reality, we need you to make it happen! Whether you can create 2D or 3D art; music or animations; code or ideas; everything is welcome! Please read our [contributors page](CONTRIBUTING.md) and join our Discord Server https://discord.gg/GhbNbvU

## Will the game be free?

Yes. The game is available to everyone, free of charge! It's a project by the community, for the community. The only costs we have are for hosting AoTTG 2 Photon Servers, and currently we are also hosting Photon Cloud servers for AoTTG. These costs are also covered by the community thanks to our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/aottg2)

## When will the game release?

AoTTG 2 will be ready for release once every issue within the [Release milestone](https://github.com/AoTTG-2/AoTTG-2/milestone/2) is completed. Please do not pay too much attention to the % number, is that is only calculated based on the amount of issues that are completed. Some issues can take weeks, others can take minutes.
