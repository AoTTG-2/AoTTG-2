# AoTTG-2
## The future of AoTTG

Welcome to the official AoTTG 2 repository! From here, we are developing an open-source project known as AoTTG 2. AoTTG 2 is a community effort to continue the development of an indie game known as "Attack on Titan Tribute Game" (AoTTG).
This game was originally released within 2014, yet development ceased ever since 2016.

The community of AoTTG is large, and by combining our powers, we have forged the AoTTG 2 community.

# When will the first release be available?
There is no known release date yet, as the project is still in its early stages. It may take weeks or months, but as Shigeru Miyamoto said: "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."

# We need YOU to make this happen!
As this project is open-source, the development is community driven. If you want to help out, please check out our discord server, and follow instructions there: https://discord.gg/GhbNbvU
Whether you create 2D art, 3D art, music, animations, code or ideas, everything is welcome!
